The animal kingdom is divided into invertebrates and vertebrates, with invertebrates making up 98% of all animals and vertebrates falling into the Phylum Chordata and having a backbone or notochord. All animals lack cell walls and are multicellular eukaryotes, with different body plans and symmetry and possessing a gut, body cavity, and differentiated tissues. There are various phyla within the animal kingdom, including Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, and Chordata. Within Chordata, there are three subphyla: Tunicata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata, with vertebrates having a body cavity that holds the body systems and organs made of four types of tissue. Vertebrates can be classified into different classes, including Agnatha, Osteichthyes, Chondrichthyes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia, with mammals being endothermic, tetrapod, (mostly) viviparous organisms with four-chambered hearts, hair/fur, and mammary glands.
