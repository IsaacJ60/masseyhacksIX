The Animalia Kingdom is divided into two groups: invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates make up 98% of animals and are animals without a backbone, while vertebrates have a backbone or notochord and make up only 2% of animals. All animals are heterotrophic, multicellular eukaryotes, and lack cell walls, and most are motile. There are different body plans and symmetry, ranging from asymmetrical to radial and bilateral symmetry. Animals also have different types of tissue, including epithelial, nervous, muscle, and connective tissue. There are various phyla of animals, such as Phylum Porifera (sponges), Phylum Cnidaria (jellyfish, sea anemones), and Phylum Echinodermata (starfish). The Phylum Chordata includes Tunicata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata, which includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Mammals are diverse in their morphology and habitats, and they are endothermic, tetrapod, and (mostly) viviparous animals with four-chambered hearts, hair/fur, and mammary glands.
