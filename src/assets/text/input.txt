The animal kingdom is divided into two main groups: invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates make up about 98% of all animals, while vertebrates fall into the Phylum Chordata and have a backbone or notochord. All animals share certain characteristics, including being multicellular eukaryotes and lacking cell walls. Animals can have different body plans and symmetry, and can possess a gut, body cavity, and differentiated tissues. There are various phyla within the animal kingdom, including Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, and Chordata. Within Chordata, there are three subphyla: Tunicata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata. Vertebrates have a body cavity that holds the body systems, and organs made of four types of tissue. Vertebrates can be classified into different classes, including Agnatha, Osteichthyes, Chondrichthyes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia. Mammals are endothermic, tetrapod, (mostly) viviparous organisms with four-chambered hearts, hair/fur, and mammary glands.
