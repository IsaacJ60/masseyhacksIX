The process of breathing in mammals involves the movement of air through the alveoli, which are composed of single-cell epithelium and surrounded by capillaries. Boyle's Law explains how the creation of negative pressure in the lungs during inhalation allows air to enter. The diaphragm and external intercostal muscles expand the thoracic volume and decrease pressure, drawing air in. Normal breathing involves a tidal volume of about 500 ml, with a vital capacity depending on gender. Breathing rate is controlled by CO2 levels sensed by the Medulla Oblongata and chemoreceptors, with hyperventilation and hypoventilation occurring when blood gas levels are unbalanced. Hemoglobin in red blood cells helps transport oxygen through the bloodstream.

The Dynamic Process of Breathing	
Remember….	- In mammals, inspired air travels through to the alveolus.
- Each alveolus is composed of epithelium that is once cell thick and is surrounded by blood capillaries that are also once cell thick. This allows for diffusion of gasses to occur.
- There are about 30 billion capillaries in both lungs, or about 100 capillaries per alveolus.

	- Air is drawn into the lungs by the creation of a negative or sub-atmospheric pressure
- In accordance with Boyle’s Law, when the volume of a given quantity of gas increases, its pressure decreases
- This occurs because the volume of the thorax is increased during inspiration (inhalation), and the lungs expand.
- When the pressure within the lungs is lower than the atmospheric pressure, air enters the lungs. 
- Mechanics of 

Mechanics of Breathing (Inhalation)	- Thoracic volume is increased with help of TWO muscles – diaphragm and external intercostal muscles
- Contraction of the intercostal muscles causes the  rib cage to expand and raises the rib cage. 
- Contraction of the diaphragm causes it to lower and assume a more flattened shape.

Mechanics of Breathing (exhalation)	- Relaxation of external intercostal muscles and diaphragm produces unforced exhalation.
- The diaphragm relaxes and moves up

Measuring Breathing	- Tidal volume – lung volume representing the normal volume of air that is displaced between normal inhalation and exhalation when extra effort is not applied.
- In a healthy person tidal volume is about 500 ml of air into and out of the lungs
- Vital capacity – the maximum amount of air that can be expired after a forceful maximum inspiration.
- Tidal Volume can be calculated using the following equations:
- Tidal volume + inspiratory reserve volume + expiratory Reserve volume = vital capacity

Measuring Breathing	- Inspired Reserve volume – additional air taken in above tidal inhalation (deep breath in)

Breathing Rate and Control	- Normal rate of breathing is 12 – 20 breaths per minute.  
- CO2 levels control breathing rate.  
- The Medulla Oblongata senses CO2 levels and when they increase, a signal is sent to the lungs and diaphragm to increase breathing rate.  

	
Hypoventilation	- Hypo means “below”
- Occurs when ventilation is inadequate to perform needed gas exchange.
- If there is an increased [CO2] (hypercapnia) in the blood the brain signals for shallow and slow breathing.  This rids of excess CO2 and regulates the blood gases

Hyperventilation	- A.k.a overbreathing
- If there is a decreased [CO2]in the blood the brain will signal for deep and rapid breathing.  You will feel as though you cannot get enough oxygen and start to breath really quickly.  Due to decreased CO2 there will be numbness, tingling and dizziness.
- Breathing into a paper bag forces a person to breathe in carbon dioxide rather than loose more to the atmosphere helping to restore blood gas levels.

Hemoglobin and Gas Transport	- The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in the blood plasma depends directly on the PO2 of the air in the alveoli. 
- Because of oxygen’s low solubility in water, blood plasma can only carry so much oxygen.  
- In order to carry the amount of oxygen needed for the body there needs to be additional help.

Hemoglobin and Gas Transport	- Hemoglobin is a protein composed of four polypeptide chains and four organic compounds called heme groups. 

Hemoglobin and Gas Transport	- Therefore each hemoglobin can carry 4 oxygen molecules.
- Hemoglobin links up with oxygen in the lungs forming oxyhemoglobin (bright red in colour).  
- As the blood passes through capillaries it releases some oxygen becoming deoxyhemoglobin (dark red colour).  
- Because of this colour change, vessels that carry oxygenated blood are always depicted as red and those that carry oxygen depleted blood are depicted as blue.

Hemoglobin and Gas Transport	- About 8% of removed CO2 in the blood is simply dissolved in plasma; another 20% is bound to hemoglobin on the protein portion not the heme group.  Therefore there is no competition for the oxygen spots.
