The Dynamic Process of Breathing
Mechanics and Transport
In mammals, inspired air travels through to the alveolus.
Each alveolus is composed of epithelium that is once cell thick and is surrounded by blood capillaries that are also once cell thick. This allows for diffusion of gasses to occur.
There are about 30 billion capillaries in both lungs, or about 100 capillaries per alveolus.
Think of the alveolus as a microscopic air bubble whose entire surface is bathed in blood.
Remember….
Air is drawn into the lungs by the creation of a negative or sub-atmospheric pressure
In accordance with Boyle’s Law, when the volume of a given quantity of gas increases, its pressure decreases
This occurs because the volume of the thorax is increased during inspiration (inhalation), and the lungs expand.
When the pressure within the lungs is lower than the atmospheric pressure, air enters the lungs. 
Mechanics of 
Breathing
Thoracic volume is increased with help of TWO muscles – diaphragm and external intercostal muscles
Contraction of the intercostal muscles causes the  rib cage to expand and raises the rib cage. 
Contraction of the diaphragm causes it to lower and assume a more flattened shape.
This increases volume and decreases pressure of lungs causing air to be drawn in
Mechanics of Breathing (Inhalation)
Relaxation of external intercostal muscles and diaphragm produces unforced exhalation.
The diaphragm relaxes and moves up
External intercostals relax the ribs and they move down and in causing the volume in the lungs to decrease and pressure increases allowing air to exit
Mechanics of Breathing (exhalation)
Tidal volume – lung volume representing the normal volume of air that is displaced between normal inhalation and exhalation when extra effort is not applied.
In a healthy person tidal volume is about 500 ml of air into and out of the lungs

Vital capacity – the maximum amount of air that can be expired after a forceful maximum inspiration.
Tidal Volume can be calculated using the following equations:

Tidal volume + inspiratory reserve volume + expiratory Reserve volume = vital capacity

Avg for men = 4.6 L	Avg for women = 3.1 L
Measuring Breathing
Inspired Reserve volume – additional air taken in above tidal inhalation (deep breath in)
Expiratory reserve volume – additional air that can be forced out beyond regular tidal exhalation.
Measuring Breathing
Normal rate of breathing is 12 – 20 breaths per minute.  

CO2 levels control breathing rate.  
The Medulla Oblongata senses CO2 levels and when they increase, a signal is sent to the lungs and diaphragm to increase breathing rate.  
There are also chemoreceptors that detect low O2 partial pressures in the blood.  If the O2 partial pressure is really low the medulla oblongata triggers a response.  There are specific blood gas measurements that have to be maintained.  If there is a discrepancy the brain will signal a response.
Breathing Rate and Control




Hypo means “below”
Occurs when ventilation is inadequate to perform needed gas exchange.
If there is an increased [CO2] (hypercapnia) in the blood the brain signals for shallow and slow breathing.  This rids of excess CO2 and regulates the blood gases
Breath holding can help to regulate breathing rate
Hypoventilation
A.k.a overbreathing
If there is a decreased [CO2]in the blood the brain will signal for deep and rapid breathing.  You will feel as though you cannot get enough oxygen and start to breath really quickly.  Due to decreased CO2 there will be numbness, tingling and dizziness.
Breathing into a paper bag forces a person to breathe in carbon dioxide rather than loose more to the atmosphere helping to restore blood gas levels.

Hyperventilation
The amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in the blood plasma depends directly on the PO2 of the air in the alveoli. 
Because of oxygen’s low solubility in water, blood plasma can only carry so much oxygen.  
In order to carry the amount of oxygen needed for the body there needs to be additional help.
This help comes from a specialized structure found in the RBC – the hemoglobin
Hemoglobin and Gas Transport
Hemoglobin is a protein composed of four polypeptide chains and four organic compounds called heme groups. 
 At the centre of the heme group is an atom of iron which can bind to one molecule of oxygen.
Hemoglobin and Gas Transport
Therefore each hemoglobin can carry 4 oxygen molecules.
Hemoglobin links up with oxygen in the lungs forming oxyhemoglobin (bright red in colour).  
As the blood passes through capillaries it releases some oxygen becoming deoxyhemoglobin (dark red colour).  
Because of this colour change, vessels that carry oxygenated blood are always depicted as red and those that carry oxygen depleted blood are depicted as blue.

Hemoglobin and Gas Transport
About 8% of removed CO2 in the blood is simply dissolved in plasma; another 20% is bound to hemoglobin on the protein portion not the heme group.  Therefore there is no competition for the oxygen spots.
The remaining 72% diffuses into RBC’s and through a reaction is turned into carbonic acid and is later diffused out.  This accounts for the pH of the blood
