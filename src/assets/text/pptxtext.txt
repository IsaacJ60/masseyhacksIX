Adaptation and Variation
Adaptation – is a structure, behaviour, or physiological process that help an organism survive and reproduce in a particular environment.
Ex. Camouflage, hibernation, needle sharp talons
Adaptation and Survival







The ability to mimic something that they are not
Ex. Many harmless species resemble a harmful species in colouration or structure.  Predators that avoid that species will also avoid the mimic.  
Mimicry
Adaptations are the result of gradual, accumulative changes that help an organism survive and reproduce.
These are due to random mutations in DNA  that accumulate over generations.
Variations are structural, functional or physiological differences between individuals of a species.
NOT ALL VARIATIONS BECOME ADAPTATIONS
Development of Adaptations
Environmental conditions determine whether a variation has a positive or negative effect or no effect o the ability to survive or reproduce.
A helpful variation is more likely to survive and be passed on.
Those variations that are passed on become more frequent in a population and become a characteristic of the population
Not all characteristics are beneficial at the time but may become beneficial
Ex. Peppered Moth
Development and Adaptations
MUTATIONS – are changes in the genetic material
Can occur spontaneously altering the alleles in an individual
May cause a new characteristic that can be beneficial to a species
What Leads to Genetic Variation?
Mutations that had no advantage or were even a disadvantage may become favourable in a changing environment.  This can provide a SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE – a genetic advantage of one organism over its competitors. 
Selective advantages help organisms survive a changing environment and reproduce

Ex. Daphnia (water flea) survive in 27 degree celcius water but a mutation allows some to survive 25-30 degrees
Selective Advantage
Some organisms reproduce rapidly ex. Bacteria
A single mutation may provide a benefit and because of rapid reproduction the entire population can survive due to the one mutation.
Ex. Antibiotic resistance
Selective Advantage
