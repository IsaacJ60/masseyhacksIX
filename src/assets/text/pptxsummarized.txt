Kingdom Animalia is divided into invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates make up 98% of all animals, while vertebrates make up the remaining 2% in the Phylum Chordata. Animals are heterotrophic, multicellular eukaryotes that lack cell walls and are usually motile. Different groups of animals have different body plans and symmetries. There are many phyla, such as Porifera, Cnidaria, Annelida, and Mollusca, each with unique characteristics. Vertebrates are in the subphylum Vertebrata and have a body cavity that holds their internal organs. There are several classes of vertebrates, including Agnatha, Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia.
