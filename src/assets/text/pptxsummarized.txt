The Kingdom Animalia is divided into two groups: invertebrates and vertebrates, with 98% of all animals being invertebrates. Animals share common characteristics such as being multicellular eukaryotes, heterotrophic, and lacking cell walls. The body plan and symmetry of animals vary, with some having radial symmetry and others having bilateral symmetry. Different types of animal tissue include epithelial, nervous, muscle, and connective tissue. The Phylum Chordata is divided into subphyla, including Tunicata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata. Vertebrates have a body cavity that holds the body systems, with organs made of four types of tissue. Classes of vertebrates include Agnatha, Osteichthyes, Chondrichthyes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia, which are diverse in morphology and habitat.
