The animal kingdom is divided into two main groups: invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates make up about 98% of all animals while vertebrates only make up 2% and fall into the Phylum Chordata. All animals share certain characteristics such as being multicellular and lacking cell walls. They also have different body plans and symmetries. Different phyla are identified such as Porifera (sponges), Cnidaria (jellyfish), and Arthropoda (insects and crustaceans), among others. The subphylum Vertebrata, which includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, have a body cavity that holds their body systems. Mammals are diverse and have hair/fur, mammary glands, and can be placental or marsupial.
