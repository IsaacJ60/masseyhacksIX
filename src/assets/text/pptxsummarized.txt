The Kingdom Animalia is divided into two main groups, invertebrates and vertebrates. 98% of all animals are invertebrates, while vertebrates make up only 2% and fall into the Phylum Chordata. All animals share certain characteristics, such as being multicellular eukaryotes, lacking cell walls, and being heterotrophic. The arrangement of an animal's body parts is called its symmetry, and there are three types: asymmetrical, radial symmetry, and bilateral symmetry. Different types of animals have different body plans, such as flatworms, roundworms, segmented worms, mollusks, arthropods, and echinoderms. The subphylum Vertebrata includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, and all vertebrates have a body cavity holding body systems. Each class of vertebrates has unique characteristics and habitats.
