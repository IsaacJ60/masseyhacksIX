The Kingdom Animalia is divided into invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates make up 98% of animals and include porifera, cnidaria, flatworms, roundworms, segmented worms, mollusks, arthropods, and echinoderms. Vertebrates make up the remaining 2% and fall into the Phylum Chordata, which includes tunicata, cephalochordata, and vertebrata. Vertebrates have a body cavity that holds organ systems, and include agnatha, chondrichthyes, osteichthyes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Mammals are endothermic, tetrapod, viviparous organisms with four-chambered hearts, hair/fur, and mammary glands.
