The efficient respiration of organisms involves the acquisition and distribution of oxygen and the disposal of carbon dioxide. Different organisms have special respiratory organs to meet their needs. Gills are examples of respiratory structures that aquatic organisms possess. Amphibians and mammals have lungs and the latter has millions of alveoli for gas exchange, with different parts of the respiratory system having specific features such as ciliated cells that secrete mucous to trap particles and hair in the nose that filters out dust and dirt particles. Lungs are enveloped by the pleura, which allows them to expand and contract.
