The text explains adaptation and variation in organisms. Adaptation refers to structures, behaviors, or physiological processes that help organisms survive and reproduce in a particular environment, while variation refers to differences between individuals of a species. Not all variations become adaptations, and adaptations are the result of gradual, accumulative changes due to random mutations in DNA that accumulate over generations. Environmental conditions determine whether a variation has a positive or negative effect on the ability to survive or reproduce. Mutations can cause new characteristics in organisms, and those that provide a selective advantage help organisms survive a changing environment and reproduce.
