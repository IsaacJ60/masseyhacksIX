The process of breathing in mammals involves the movement of air through the alveoli, which are composed of single-cell epithelium and surrounded by capillaries. Boyle's Law explains how the creation of negative pressure in the lungs during inhalation allows air to enter. The diaphragm and external intercostal muscles expand the thoracic volume and decrease pressure, drawing air in. Normal breathing involves a tidal volume of about 500 ml, with a vital capacity depending on gender. Breathing rate is controlled by CO2 levels sensed by the Medulla Oblongata and chemoreceptors, with hyperventilation and hypoventilation occurring when blood gas levels are unbalanced. Hemoglobin in red blood cells helps transport oxygen through the bloodstream.
