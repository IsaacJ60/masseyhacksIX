The Animalia Kingdom is composed of invertebrates and vertebrates, with invertebrates making up 98% and vertebrates making up 2% of all animals. All animals lack cell walls and are multicellular eukaryotes that are heterotrophic, with most being motile. There are various body plans ranging from asymmetrical to radial and bilateral symmetry. Animals are composed of different types of tissue, including epithelial, nervous, muscle, and connective tissue. Different phyla include sponges, jellyfish, sea anemones, starfish, and vertebrates such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Mammals have unique characteristics, including endothermic bodies, being tetrapods, and mostly giving birth to live young, having four-chambered hearts, hair/fur, and mammary glands.
