The animal kingdom is divided into two groups, invertebrates and vertebrates, with 98% of all animals being invertebrates. Animals share certain characteristics such as being multicellular eukaryotes, heterotrophic, and lacking cell walls. An animal's body symmetry and body plan differs between species. The phyla of animals, such as porifera, cnidaria, worms, mollusks, arthropods, and echinoderms, are discussed as well as the classes of vertebrates including agnatha, osteichthyes, chondrichthyes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Each class is described in detail with their unique characteristics and features. Overall, the animal kingdom is vast and diverse, with a wide range of species that have developed unique characteristics to fit their environment.
