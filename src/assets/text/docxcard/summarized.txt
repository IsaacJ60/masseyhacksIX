The Kingdom Animalia is split into invertebrates and vertebrates, with 98% of animals being invertebrates and vertebrates making up only 2%. All animals are multicellular eukaryotes, lack cell walls, and are heterotrophic. Animal symmetry can be asymmetrical, radial symmetry, or bilateral symmetry, and animals have different body plans such as flatworms, roundworms, segmented worms, mollusks, arthropods, and echinoderms. Vertebrates include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, each with unique characteristics and habitats. All vertebrates have a body cavity that holds body systems.
