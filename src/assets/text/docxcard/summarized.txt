Mammals breathe through the movement of air through the alveoli, which are surrounded by capillaries. Boyle's Law explains how negative pressure in the lungs during inhalation allows air to enter. The diaphragm and external intercostal muscles expand thoracic volume and decrease pressure, drawing air in. Normal breathing involves tidal volume of about 500 ml, with vital capacity depending on gender. Medulla Oblongata and chemoreceptors control breathing rate through CO2 level sensing with hypoventilation and hyperventilation occurring when blood gas levels are unbalanced. Hemoglobin in red blood cells helps transport oxygen through the bloodstream.
