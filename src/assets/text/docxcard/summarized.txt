The animal kingdom is divided into two main groups: invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates make up about 98% of all animals. All animals are multicellular eukaryotes without cell walls and can have different body plans and symmetry, as well as a gut, body cavity, and differentiated tissues. There are various phyla within the animal kingdom, including Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, and Chordata. Within Chordata, there are three subphyla: Tunicata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata. Vertebrates have a backbone or notochord and are classified into different classes, including Agnatha, Osteichthyes, Chondrichthyes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia. Mammals are a type of vertebrate and have certain characteristics such as being endothermic, tetrapod, (mostly) viviparous, having four-chambered hearts, hair/fur, and mammary glands.
