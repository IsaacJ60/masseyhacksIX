The text discusses how respiration and breathing occur in different organisms. Gas exchange requires special organs like gills, lungs, and skin which provide surface area for the exchange of gases. Aquatic animals have gills, which increase the surface area, but can be easily damaged and depleted of oxygen. Mammals have a more efficient respiratory system with lungs that have air sacs called alveoli, which provide an abundance of surface area for gas exchange. The respiratory system includes various parts like nostrils, nose hair, turbinates, sinuses, pharynx, glottis, epiglottis, larynx, trachea, ciliated cells, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, and pleura. Each part has a specific function and helps to maximize the efficiency of respiration.
