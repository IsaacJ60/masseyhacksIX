Front: How do mammals breathe?
Back: Mammals breathe through the movement of air through the alveoli, which are surrounded by capillaries.

Front: What explains how negative pressure in the lungs during inhalation allows air to enter?
Back: Boyle's Law explains how negative pressure in the lungs during inhalation allows air to enter.

Front: What are the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles responsible for in breathing?
Back: The diaphragm and external intercostal muscles expand thoracic volume and decrease pressure, drawing air in.

Front: What is the normal tidal volume in breathing?
Back: Normal breathing involves tidal volume of about 500 ml.

Front: What does vital capacity depend on?
Back: Vital capacity depends on gender.

Front: What controls breathing rate and blood gas levels in the body?
Back: Medulla Oblongata and chemoreceptors control breathing rate through CO2 level sensing with hypoventilation and hyperventilation occurring when blood gas levels are unbalanced.

Front: What helps transport oxygen through the bloodstream?
Back: Hemoglobin in red blood cells helps transport oxygen through the bloodstream.
